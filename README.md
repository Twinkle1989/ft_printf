# ft_printf
**Overview**

The ft_printf project is a detailed reimplementation of the classic printf() function, a staple in C programming. This project was undertaken as part of the 42School curriculum, challenging students to not only mimic printf() but also to deepen their understanding of variadic functions and their applications in C.
