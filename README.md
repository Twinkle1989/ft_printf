# ft_printf
**Overview**
</br>
The ft_printf project is a detailed reimplementation of the classic printf() function, a staple in C programming. This project was undertaken as part of the 42School curriculum, challenging students to not only mimic printf() but also to deepen their understanding of variadic functions and their applications in C.

**Project Details**
</br>
1. Program Name: libftprintf.a
2. Files Submitted: Makefile, *.h, */*.h, *.c, */*.c
3. Makefile Targets: NAME, all, clean, fclean, re
4. External Functions Used: malloc, free, write, va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end
5. Library: Usage of libft is authorized and integrated.
</br>

**Features**
</br>
Custom ft_printf() Function: A function that mimics the original printf() but does not implement the buffer management.
</br>
1. Handled Conversions: Supports c, s, p, d, i, u, x, X, and %% to handle a diverse range of outputs such as characters, strings, pointers, and numbers in various formats.
2. Library Creation: The library libftprintf.a is created using the ar command, strictly adhering to the project's guidelines against using libtool.
</br>

**Learning Outcomes**
</br>
1. Deep Dive into C Standard Library Functions: By recreating printf(), this project provides hands-on experience with low-level programming concepts.
2. Variadic Functions: Enhanced understanding of handling an undefined number of arguments, crucial for flexible function design.
3. Precision in Memory Management and Type Handling: Gaining skills in managing memory and understanding type specifics in C, pivotal for performance-critical applications.
